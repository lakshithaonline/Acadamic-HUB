# Tech Stack

Academic HUB is built using a modern and versatile tech stack that leverages Firebase for database management and real-time communication. Here's a breakdown of our tech choices:

## Frontend

- **React:** Our frontend is developed using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It provides a seamless and responsive experience for users.

- **Material-UI:** We've used Material-UI components to create a consistent and visually appealing design for the user interface.

## Backend

- **Firebase:** Our backend heavily relies on Firebase for authentication, real-time database management, and cloud functions. Firebase offers scalability, security, and seamless integration for modern applications.

## Additional Tools

- **Firebase Cloud Functions:** For serverless computing and custom backend functionality, we utilize Firebase Cloud Functions.

- **Firebase Authentication:** To ensure secure user access, authentication is managed through Firebase Authentication services.

This tech stack combination enables us to deliver a dynamic and responsive platform to university students, ensuring a seamless experience as they access resources, collaborate, and excel in their academic pursuits.
